I am a third-year PhD student in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois Chicago, supervised by Prof. Hulya Seferoglu. I hold a Bachelor's from IUST and a Master's from Sharif University of Technology. I'm interested in machine learning, optimization, and their intersections with decentralized systems and networking.
